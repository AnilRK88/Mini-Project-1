Problem Statement:
It is tough and time consuming to bend and shape wires manually. We hope to solve the issue by automating the process using CNC concept.

Objectives: 
To design the various components used in the machine.
To make it 3D printing friendly.
To make it user friendly.
To make it economical.

Components Required:
Arduino Nano, DRV8825 Motor drivers, LM 7805 voltage regulator
Stepper motors, Servo Motors, Ball Bearings.
Gears, Hollow shaft.
Nuts and bolts.

Applications:
Can be used in making complex wire objects such as paper clips, hooks.
Can be used in creating structural framework base for 3D printed objects.
Stronger and durable versions of the machine can be used in construction works for creating steel foundations.

Advantages:
Allows for unique designs.
Reduces human error.
High precision can be achieved.
Reduces cost and time.

Disadvantages:
Requires a skilled operator.
Maintenance might be costly due to use of gears.
